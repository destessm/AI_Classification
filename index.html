      <h1>Hi!</h1>
      <h2>I'm David Estes-Smargiassi!</h2>
      <p>
	I am a graduate student at Stevens Institute of Technology pursuing a
	Master's degree in Computer Science on track to graduate in May 2017. I
	received my B.A. in Music and Technology and minor in Computer Science
	at the same university in May 2016, focusing heavily on
	composition. <br><br>
	
	Video games are my passion. I have played video games for as long as I
	can remember, and many have positively impacted my life. Pokemon got me
	into handheld gaming. Age of Empires and Simcity 3000 got me into PC
	gaming. Diablo II was the first game that I played at a LAN party. I
	played Halo 3 with my friends every friday night for most of
	high school. More recently I've been playing Overwatch, Hearthstone,
	Civilization V and VI and Cities: Skylines. I've also been playing some
	indie games like The Witness and Subnautica. <br><br>

	When I first got into programming in high school, the first
	extracurricular project that I created was a clone of connect
	four. During my undergrad, I began teaching myself the Unity game engine
	in order to try to build more complex games. Using this engine, I
	created a number of small games including a few 2D platformers and a
	top-down beat-em-up style game. Even my Bachelor's thesis was on
	compositional style and form for video game soundtracking. <br><br>

	All of the games that I have made can be found at the links above. Have
	fun playing them and send me an email if you have any comments or
	suggestions! My soundcloud, which is also linked above, showcases a
	number of pieces that I have written, including some of the soundtracks
	for the games that I have made. <br><br>

	In addition to my love of games, I also love creating sound design and
	scores for visual media. Foley recording allows me to use my audio
	production skills in a fun and creative way. To see samples of my work
	in sound design and scoring, please contact me by any of the methods
	found on the contact page. <br><br>
	
	My audio resume and my computer science resume can be found in the links
	above as well. Please contact me if you have any inqueries.
